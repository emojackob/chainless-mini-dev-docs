## Mini-Program SDK

As a third-party developer, you can access the official Chainless Developer Platform to quickly register as a developer and easily create and publish mini-programs.

### Development process:  
Register → Create a mini-program → Create a version and publish code within the mini-program → Get approved and go live

    A mini-program is the main entity through which third-party developers deliver their program functionalities. After creating a mini-program and passing the platform's review, developers can release different versions of the code under the mini-program entity. The Chainless platform will assist with the release and launch process.
